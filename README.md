#Glorietta Industries
This is a personal project in making a functional prototype for a fake company called Glorietta. The layout for the homepage is inspired by the [Broadway project](https://codepen.io/SonyaMoisset/pen/rVgLdw) on Codecademy's old HTML and CSS course.

#How am I doing?
If you see something in this website that I could be doing better at, by all means, give me feedback on it. Feel free to open an issue or [tweet me](https://twitter.com/dombrant)
