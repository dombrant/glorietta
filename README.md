# Glorietta Industries
This is a personal project in making a functional prototype for a fake company called Glorietta. The layout for the homepage is inspired by the [Broadway project](https://codepen.io/SonyaMoisset/pen/rVgLdw) on Codecademy's old HTML and CSS course. Check it out at https://dombrant.github.io/glorietta/
